				of your little ones, while keeping them active. 
				Playing with TekyGo! and friends will, 
				through physical activity, improve their focus, 
				flexibility and posture. Through interactive 
				learning they can increase their creative and 
				cognitive skills and develop new skills while 
				having LOTS of fun at every stage in their 
				development.</view><view class="f21rpx color-H0f649c fw800" style="margin:0 40rpx 40rpx;">Get to Know TekyGo!</view><view class="f21rpx color-H0f649c" style="margin:0 40rpx 40rpx;line-height:26rpx;">TekyGo! lives inside of the phones, tablets, 
				computers, and TV’s of every home. Like you,
				TekyGo! watches the same boring programs 
				or is always slouched overplaying the same 
				boring video games.</view><view class="f21rpx color-H0f649c" style="margin:0 40rpx 40rpx;line-height:26rpx;">You can’t see TekyGo! because TekyGo! is as
				small as a spec, even smaller some say. But 
				TekyGo! is there… always searching for a way 
				to escape. You can help TekyGo! but the only 
				way is to open a portal and shout these 4 
				magic words “3… 2... 1... TekyGo!” If you do it 
				just right, TekyGo! will instantly transform 
				from a spec on your screen into TekyGo! 
				The powerful robot loves to play, sing, dance, 
				jump, and learn with all of the children of the 
				world. The more you play with TekyGo! the 
				stronger and smarter TekyGo! will get. That 
				means more adventures for you to take 
				together!</view><view style="height:40rpx;"></view></scroll-view></view></view>
